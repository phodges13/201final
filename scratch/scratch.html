            <ol>
                <li>Season 1</li>
                <span>With some of the most iconic episodes and storylines, the first season is easily the best season of "Arrested Development".</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"Pier Pressure" (Episode 10)</li>
                        <li>"Key Decisions" (Episode 4)</li>
                        <li>"Pilot" (Episode 1)</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Season 3</li>
                <span>This was such a silly season and the story came full circle for the Bluth family with heavy nods to the pilot in the season finale.</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"Development Arrested" (Episode 13)</li>
                        <li>"The Cabin Show" (Episode 1)</li>
                        <li>"Fakin' It" (Episode 10)</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Season 2</li>
                <span>This is a good season with a lot of memorable moments. Most of the memes related to the show come out of season 2.</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"The One Where Michael Leaves" (Epsiode 1)</li>
                        <li>"Amigos!" (Episode 3)</li>
                        <li>"Good Grief" (Episode 4)</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Seasons 4 and 5</li>
                <span>Once Netflix got a hold of the franchise, everything started to go downhill. The writers tried to pick up the story where season 3 left off, but the actors looked noticably older and the story felt drawn out. I'm just going to leave these two seasons at the bottom together because they're honestly so bad.</span>
